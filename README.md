However,   you   can use   the pause   function   in   Zoom.Technical   issues:   This   task   aims   to   exercise   students’   virtual   learning   and   working   abilities.   Students   are   expected   to    self-resolve   the   technical   issues   and   record   the   video   using   Zoom.   Students   are   responsible   for   ensuring   the   image   and   audio   are   functioning   well   in   the   video   and   that   the uploading   file   does   not   exceed   the   required   length   and   size.

AI      and      Gen    AI      must      not      be      used      to      generate      a   written   response   to   the   assessment   task   or   any   part   of   it   and   you   must   not   copy   paste      from      Gen      AI.

All       images       etc       must       be       acknowledged       in       the       submitted       task.      A      full   declaration   of   AI use   must   be provided   as per   the   instructions   in   the   assessment   task.
.                      In    addition,   you   need   to    screenshot   all   conversations   with   generative   AI   tools   and   attach   them   to   the   appendix   of   your   report.
